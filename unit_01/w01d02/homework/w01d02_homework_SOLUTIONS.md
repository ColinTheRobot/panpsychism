**Answer:** `git reset` and the name of the file
1. What command do you use to change your files back to how they were after a commit?<br>
**Answer:** `git checkout --`<target folder or file that was commited>
1. Why is it important to use `--` when chaging files back to a previous state?<br>
**Answer:** It's promising the command line that there are no more options after the '--'. This way if you happen to have a branch named octocat.txt, it will still revert the file, instead of switching to the branch of the same name.
