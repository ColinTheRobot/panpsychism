Your Tuesday homeworks are "longer" than the homeworks that you receive on other nights of the week because they are meant to span between two nights: Tuesday & Wednesday.

You will have the following to complete:

1) Git practice <br>
2) Command Line Murders<br>
3) Get to know Slack<br>
4) Brook & Lyn <br>
This is HTML & CSS Practice. You may not be able to finish all of these steps, but you should get pretty far today from the lesson that Matt gave and the material that you covered in your Fundamentals.

You will be adding your work and commiting it throughout each exercise. 

Follow the directions in the homework submission guidlines (found in the Panthalassa wiki <https://github.com/ga-students/wdi-remote/wiki>). Please submit this homework by 10:00 am EDT on Thursday, May 19th.
