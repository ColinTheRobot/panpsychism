# Homework - Master Your Mockup

![mockup picture with cat](http://www.oddities123.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/funny-twins-8.jpg)

For tonight's homework you have the option of doing one of two website mockups. We have provided the image files needed to create a mockup for each website, but you will need to create the `index.hml` file and the `style.css`.

Decide whether you want to re-create `VSSL` or `Supply`.

Do the following commits:

**Commit 1** <br>
<hr>
Once you have setup the basic structure in your HTML file, save it, add it, and commit it. The commit message should read: <br>
"Set up basic HTML file"
<hr>

**Commit 2** <br>
<hr>
Once you have created and saved your CSS file, add it and commit it. The commit message should read: <br>
"Created a CSS file"
<hr>

**Commit 3** <br>
<hr>
Once you have linked your CSS file to your HTML file (make sure to test it - change the background color of the page to ensure that it's properly linked), add it and commit it. Need a reminder on how to do this? Check out this link on how to [link an external style sheet] (http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_howto.asp).
The commit message should read: <br>
"The CSS file is successfully linked to the HTML file"
<hr>

**Commit 4** <br>
<hr>
Once you have the pictures displaying on your page (they don't have to be in the right place on the page, they just need to be on your page), take a screenshot, title it `mockup_with_pictures_pre_styling`. Save this to your homework folder. The commit message should read: <br>
"The images were loaded to the HTML, but not styled yet"
<hr>

**Commit 5** <br>
<hr>
Once you have successfully created the mockup (or once you're too tired to continue and need to go to bed), take a screenshot of your work and title it `mockup_with_styling`. Save this to your homework folder. Come up with your own appropriate commit message. <br>
