# Javascript Basics

![js](http://www.mastergradeit.co.za/files/thumb/289/200)

## Setup

Make a folder called `js_basics` inside your homework folder. Inside `js_basics` touch an index.html and an app.js and link them together. Write all of your javascript answers in `app.js`, and test them in the Chrome console.

Any non-javascript written answers can be made into a comment in your js file by putting a pound # at the beginning of the line. Alternatively, comment out written work by using `command + /` in sublime. You can select blocks of text and comment them out with this shortcut.


## Conceptual Questions

1. How do we assign a value to a variable? 
2. How do we change the value of a variable? 
3. How do we assign an existing variable to a new variable?
4. How do we use a variable within an expression? 

## Exercises

1. Create a variable called `firstVariable`.
  - assign it the value of a string => `"Hello World"`
  - change the value of this variable to a number.
  - store the value of `firstVariable` into a new variable called `secondVariable` 
  - change the value of `secondVariable` to a string. 
  - What is the value of `firstVariable`?

2. Create a variable called `yourName` and set it equal to your name as a string.
  - Write an expression that takes the string "Hello, my name is " and the variable `yourName` so that it returns a new string with them concatenated. 
  *(ex: "Hello, my name is Jean Valjean")*

# Javascript Primitives 

## Conceptual Questions

1. Name 4 different built in primitives in Javascript.
2. What is the difference between an integer and a float?
4. How do you create an empty array and store it in a variable?

## Exercises

1. Given the following array `var a = [1, 10, "Hello", true]`
  - how do you access the 1st element in the array?
  - Change the value of `"Hello"` to `"World"`.
  - Check the value of `a` to make sure it updated the array. 
  
2. Given the following array `["Meeseeks", "Coldness", "21 Berry", "Venkman"]`
    - What would you write to access the 3rd element of the array?
    - Change the value of "Venkman" to "Slimer"
    - Add a new element, "Cloud City" to the array.

3. Create a string that contains quotes and store it in a variable. 

4. What is the result from the expression `"World" * 5`. Why?


# JavaScript - Primitive Methods & Properties


## Conceptual Questions

1. List at least 5 properties built into a string.
2. List at least 2 method examples built into an array.

## Exercises

1. Given the following string `"The Peculiar Purple Pieman of Porcupine Peak"`
    - How can we check the length of this string?
 

3. Given the following array `[5,10,500,20]`
    - using the `push` method, add the string `"Egon"` to the end of the array.
    - using a different method, remove the string from the end of the array.
    - using the `unshift` method, add the string `"Bob Marley"` to the beginning of the array
    - using a different method, remove the string from the beginning of the array

# Javascript - operators

## Exercises


#### 1.
Using the provided variable definitions, replace the blanks with a mathematical or boolean operator that evaluates the expression to true. :wave:

```
  var a = 4;
  var b = 53;
  var c = 57;
  var d = 16;
  var e = 'Kevin';
```

-  a _ b;
-  c _ d;
-  'Name' ___ 'Name';
-  a _ b ___ c;
-  a _ a ___ d;
-  e ___ 'Kevin';
-  48 ___ '48';
