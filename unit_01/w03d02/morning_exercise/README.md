# Morning Exercise

With these morning exercises, we want you to think about how to, not only tackle the problem, but to see how effeciently you can solve them. Solve this one in **two** different ways.

## The Biggest Difference

Write a function that takes in the array and returns the **largest difference** between any **two** of its elements. You can assume that the array is all numbers and that there are no duplicates.

The starter code:
``` javascript
  var biggestDifference = function(arr){
    // code goes here...
  }

  biggestDifference([1,4,7,3,2]) // would return 6
  biggestDifference([9, 20, 5, -6, -1, 8]) // would return 26
```
