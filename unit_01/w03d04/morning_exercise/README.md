## CSS Frameworks

We're going to be looking at some popular CSS frameworks. A CSS framework can save you time for styling applications. A framework is really just a stylesheet that has been designed by someone else that you are implimenting into your code. You can make changes to the styles using your own stylesheet. You can use them to snazz up your projects, but we also want you to be familiar with them because, a lot of times when you jump in to a company and look at their code, you will encounter the use of a CSS framework. 

Some frameworks that we will be looking at today:

[Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/)<br>
  _Lightweight framework that has a nice, simple grid system_

[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)<br>
  _Probably the most popular framework out there right now. Originally created by some guys who were working at Twitter_

[Materialize](http://materializecss.com/)<br>
_This framework is difficult to manipulate, but I like it for the parralax and the cards_

[Pure CSS](http://purecss.io/)<br>
_Similar to skeleton, this is a light framework with a grid system and responsive design_
