// Require express so that we can set the router


// set express.Router() to a variable, router



// require the pokemon model and save it to a variable, Pokemon



// router.get '/', and send all the model data to the 'index.ejs' view



// router.get '/:id', and send the specific pokemon's data to be rendered 
// on the 'show.ejs' view. In this case, the :id will be used to refer to 
// the index of the pokemon in the pokemon.js array. Remember req.params.



// export the router so the middleware can use it
