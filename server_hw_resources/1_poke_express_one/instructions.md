# POKEMON JSON

## Express app for Pokemon data


Tonight you'll be making an app for displaying Pokemon JSON data.

### Directions

- Inside package.json, `express` is defined as a dependency. You can simply run `npm install` without any extra arguments in the project directory to install all of the dependencies listed in package.json

- Run `npm install` in the pokemon_express_one directory.

### Starter Code

- All the prompts for this homework are located in `server.js`. Simply follow the prompts and write in the server.js to complete the homework.

- A massive collection of Pokemon data is stored inside `poke_array.js`. This data is an *array* of *objects* that is ready to export using module.exports. You don't need to modify this file.

- You will need to import / reference this data in your `server.js` using the `require` keyword, specifying a path to the file, and saving it to a variable.

- The app is simply going to send JSON to the client.

- The specific JSON that user gets back will depend on the url requested by the user in the client. For some of the prompts, this may require some programming!  

- Start simply, build the app piece by piece testing each piece along the way.
