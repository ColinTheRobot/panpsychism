STOP! WATCH TIME!

Lets write a browser stopwatch app. Here are the user stories.

1. The user should be able to see the current amount of time that has gone by at any given point.
2. The user should be able to start the stopwatch.
3. the user should be able to stop the stopwatch.
4. The user should be able to reset the stopwatch.
5. Bonus: The user should be able to [make and reset splits](http://news.runtowin.com/2007/05/08/what-is-the-difference-between-split-times-and-lap-times.html) that appear somewhere on the page.

We have given you the starter file to use with a basic layout for the html so that you can focus on the Javascript.  Before you start to code, organize your thoughts by asking yourself these questions:

1. What information am I going to need to store.
2. What events will I need and how will I have them interact with the web page.
3. What kind of funtions will I need in order to change the data?

Hint: When you get to the "reset" portion of your stopwatch, try Javascript's `setInterval()` method.
