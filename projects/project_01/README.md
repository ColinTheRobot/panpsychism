## Attendance
You are required to be present by 10:00 am EDT each day during the project.

## Standups
We will have student-run stand-ups each morning at 10:15 am EDT where you will answer the following questions:
- What did I work on yesterday
- What am i trying to get done today
- What is preventing me from getting this done.

This meeting should take no longer than 15 minutes.

If you have ideas on how you can help a fellow-student with work that they are stuck on, please follow-up with information AFTER the stand up.

## Meetings with instructors

## Where to go for help during project week
1. Seek out help online
2. Seek out help with your classmates
3. Seek out help with Derek (TA)
4. Submit a Github issue to receive help from an instructor

## Formatting your GitHub Issue to ask for help

*PUSH OFTEN! Your code on GitHub should be up to date. Submiting an issue and linking us to old, out-of-date code will hinder the process.*

1. **WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO SOLVE:**
  - Write a detailed explanation of the feature or user story you're working on.

2. **DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE BUG/ERROR:**
  - A detailed description of the problem, the bug, and/or the error. This means: the full steps to reproduce, a link to the file on github, and the line number of where the relavent code is.
The error(s) returned, copy and pasted/typed out/screenshot, not paraphrased.
  - If there is other code in a different file that is also essential to the functioning of the code that currently works point us to that and explain the relationship.

3. **WHAT I'VE TRIED**
  - List everything you've done to solve the bug on your own in detail. list all resources you've looked up and tried to implement and provide links. Providing code if you have it surrounded by the md syntax to display nicely is very helpful.

4. **QUESTION**
  - After going through all this what is your questions specifically, more specifically than how can I make this work?

## Deliverables

By the time the project is over, we will expect the following from you:

* A **working game, built by you**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A **link to your hosted working app** 
* A **git repository hosted on Github**  and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project
* **A ``readme.md`` file** with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, a link to your live site, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.

Most importantly a **technical demonstration** of your app which:

* Is 5 minutes in length
* Shows off all features of the app
* Explains the technical details
* Explains the technical challenges
* Explains which improvements you might make
